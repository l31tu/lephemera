					Centre for Projection Art’s Artist-In-Residence program pairs an artist who
					is emerging and experimenting with projection through their contemporary art
					practice, with an artist mentor for four months.  This provides
					opportunities for artists to develop their creative skills in the projection
					field, develop new artwork for public presentation, collaborate and expand
					their professional networks.

				<p>
					I wish to become projection literate in order to expand my film and digital
					work beyond the boundaries of screens and into activations in
					three-dimensional space. Extending upon my experience and interest in
					technologies, I am looking to construct immersive and interactive
					experiences that promote juxtaposition and exchange between virtual worlds
					and physical environments. In particular I will focus on
					developing a forthcoming exhibition that is an unconventional hybrid of
					documentary, narrative and publication. I also hope to find ways to
					integrate projected imagery into the traditionally non-digital facets of my
					practice including wearables and objects.

					Goals:
					<ul>
						<li>
							question the legitimacy of, and offer alternatives to, the printed word
						</li>
						<li>
							critically dissect the structure and function of publications
						</li>
						<li>
							consider applications that incorporate installation, moving image and sound
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Aspects to build on:
					<ul>
						<li>
							‘material space for critical self-reflection and exchange’
						</li>
						<li>
							‘imbue [the publication] with a certain character’
						</li>
						<li>

						</li>
						<li>
							‘critical analysis of the content’
						</li>
						<li>
							prioritise ‘the quality of the book’s constituent parts’
						</li>
						<li>
							‘convey a narrative’
						</li>
						<li>
							comfortable for extended viewing
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Aspects to re-consider:
					<ul>
						<li>
							‘succinctly communicate’ content
						</li>
						<li>
							implied ‘objectivity’
						</li>
						<li>
							‘perfected’ conventions
						</li>
						<li>
							standard physical, visual, typographic and <span class="no-wrap">synoptical form</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							one dimensional (and directional) ‘structure and sequence’
						</li>
						<li>
							authoritarian presentation and voice
						</li>
						<li>
							solitary use
						</li>
						<li>
							static, permanent, enduring
						</li>
						<li>
							hierarchical layout
						</li>
						<li>
							application of pigment (dark markings on a lighter surface)
						</li>
						<li>
							western histories, contexts and frameworks
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					What a book generally consists of:
					<ul>
						<li>
							a container: front cover, back cover, spine, binding
						</li>
						<li>
							kinds of pages: title page, frontispiece, colophon, acknowledgements, foreword, contents, epigraph, introduction, chapters, appendix, notes, glossary, bibliography, index
						</li>
						<li>

						<li>
							sound
						</li>

						</li>
						<li>
							people
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Other formats to borrow from:
					<ul>
						<li>
							film: title sequences that convey information while enhancing mood and providing transitions, sound enhances visuals
						</li>
						<li>
							music: layers of simultaneous sounds, harmony between different elements, collectively created
						</li>
						<li>
							visual art: (subjective) frame serving as a boundary of a work, critical exploration, indirect communication
						</li>
						<li>
							architecture: consideration of space, surrounding presence, collective viewing, collective memory, formal and informal use
						</li>
						<li>
							nature: ecologies, cycles, evolving forms, biotic symbioses (mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism)

				<p>
					Exploring projection in art:
					<ul>
						<li>
							large scale projection
						</li>
						<li>
							building mapping
						</li>
						<li>
							participatory / interactive (e.g. shadow of body, doesn’t have to be technology)
						</li>
						<li>
							site responsive (e.g. connected conceptually or to features of site)
						</li>
						<li>
							object mapping (e.g. bring in or work with what’s there)
						</li>
						<li>
							installation (e.g. part of installation with other materials, multiple channels or projected elements within a space)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Site considerations:
					<ul>
						<li>
							ambient light (e.g. sunlight that changes, light from other artworks, internal lights, street lights)
						</li>
						<li>
							colour of the surface being projected onto (the darker the background the darker the blacks but the brighter the projector needs to be, lighter surface has bright image but light blacks)
						</li>
						<li>
							size of image (smaller you go the brighter the image will be)
						</li>
						<li>
							projector brightness (ambient light and size of image used to determine what projector brightness is needed, measured in lumens)
						</li>
						<li>
							artwork colour and contrast
						</li>
						<li>
							artwork shape and form (artworks that use negative space will pop)
						</li>
						<li>
							power sources
						</li>
						<li>
							safety (e.g. ratchet straps, putting projector out of sight and reach)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Examples of artists:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Team Lab (working with features of building in subtle way, highlighting elements, spectacle, technical difficulty)
						</li>
						<li>
							Club Ate (large scale building mapping with artistic integrity, ‘In Muva We Trust’ building mapping that is not cheesy, connects well to architecture)
						</li>
						<li>
							Isaac Julien (projecting onto screens installed in space, pivoted to create ‘portals’ into other spaces)
						</li>
						<li>
							Pipilotti Rist (installation with projection mapping onto specific objects and different surfaces within a space, immersive in different way by asking viewer to lie down to experience work, utilising shape of room)
						</li>
						<li>
							Maree Clarke (‘Born of the Land’, traditional aspect ratio but bringing in other, three dimensional elements into installation that cast their own shadows)
						</li>
						<li>
							Nota Bene (‘In Order to Control’,interactive typographic work that used a sensor projecting words inside viewer silhouette)
						</li>
						<li>
							Diana Thater (multichannel, combines sculpture and projection)
						</li>
						<li>
							Heather Phillipson (installation artist that uses multichannel and found elements)
						</li>
						<li>
							Nam June Paik (layering of projections, sculptural projector framework)
						</li>
						<li>
							Wonjun Jeong (projections onto fabric in mid air)
						</li>
						<li>
							Jenny Holzer (typography distorted by surfaces)
						</li>
						<li>
							Sab D’Souza (use of image and text really strong, frame references media but text pushes outside of frame)
						</li>
					</ul>

					Specifications:
					<ul>
						<li>
							resolution
						</li>
						<li>
							brightness
						</li>
						<li>
							lens throw ration (e.g. standard or short throw, determines how big image will be)
						</li>
						<li>
							contrast ratio
						</li>
						<li>
							on off axis
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Getting started:
					<ul>
						<li>
							projector specification and features will determine the image size and placement
						</li>
						<li>
							look up projector model
						</li>
						<li>
							https://www.projectorcentral.com/projection-calculator-pro.cfm (use for consistent format between models, throw distance calculator)
						</li>
						<li>
							Epsons are recommended (in terms of colours, brightness, contrast level)
						</li>
						<li>
							projectors are either LCD or DLP (light moves through in a different way, loose lumens in process of light getting out, DLP less light than LCD, if using DLP might need more lumens)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Resolution:
					<ul>
						<li>
							e.g. 4K 3840 x 2160, 1200p 1920 x 1200 (WUXGA), 1080p 1920 x 1080 (HD 1080), 800p 800 x 1280 (WXGA), 720p 720 x 1280 (HD 720)
						</li>
						<li>
							describes how clear a projected image will be based on how many pixels can be displayed on a given space
						</li>
						<li>
							one 4K player could be used in place of multiple lower resolution projectors
						</li>
						<li>
							BrightSign media player recommended for 4K
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Throw Ratio:
					<ul>
						<li>
							tells us what image size we can project from a certain distance away
						</li>
						<li>
							the smaller the throw ratio, the larger the image a projector will produce at a shorter throw distance
						</li>
						<li>
							image width x lens throw ration = throw distance
						</li>
						<li>
							take throw distance from the top of the lens and take into consideration depth of projector
						</li>
						<li>
							short throw lenses usually considered under 1:1
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Projector Offsets:
					<ul>
						<li>
							the offset measures the position of the image relative to the centreline of the lens
						</li>
						<li>
							in a projector with a 0% offset, the centre of the image lines up perfectly with the centre of the lens, assuming that the projector is pointed straight at the screen
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Set Up:
					<ul>
						<li>
							reset settings
						</li>
						<li>
							installation (e.g. front rear ceiling)
						</li>
						<li>
							focus, lens shift, zoom
						</li>
						<li>
							keystone, corner pin
						</li>
						<li>
							yes to calibration unless setup already
						</li>
						<li>
							reset all settings through menu
						</li>
						<li>
							if portrait need to mount in way that allows air flow
						</li>
						<li>
							cover all surfaces you want to project onto without going too far over edges
						</li>
						<li>
							make sure projector is secure and nothing can move either the object you are projecting onto or the projector
						</li>
						<li>
							note resolution from model (important to match the resolution)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Mapping and Masking:
					<ul>
						<li>
							masking is described as masking out a shape with black so the content fits a certain designated area
						</li>
						<li>
							mapping is described as a pre-distorting content to fit a 3D shape so the content is not distorted
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					After Effects:
					<ul>
						<li>
							extend desktop (extended display in system preferences)
						</li>
						<li>
							connect your projector as an output display showing you exactly what your artwork will look like in real time whilst editing
						</li>
						<li>
							when creating a composition be mindful of projector frame rate
						</li>

					Mapmaking:
					<ul>
						<li>
							maps that reflect the way inhabitants experienced a place instead of imposed narratives

				On 8 February was the second catch up with mentor, Abeera Kamran. The session went for 
				two hours and was structured to focus on design in the first half (dissection the 
				publication and installation feedback), and typography in the second <span class="no-wrap">(a presentation</span> 
				of Abeera's masters research and laying foundations for typographic research).
			</p>

			<button class="button" onclick="showSection('s-20')">
				<h2 id="p1">Points that were discussed</h2></label>
			</button>
			<div id="s-20" class="section">
				<p>
					‘Skylight’ installation feedback:
					<ul>
						<li>
							what worked: playful approach, publication as unbound, videos serve as 
							entry points, portrait videos feel more intimate than landscape 
							(landscape feels more formal), portrait videos also subtly echo, doors 
							section works the best (intentional ayering and close together)
						</li>
						<li>
							how it felt in the world: regular videos of life being lived, 
							extraordinary not needed
						</li>
						<li>
							what could be done differently: play more with composition
						</li>
						<li>
							what didn't work: connections to other iterations of volume accross mediums 
							so the ghost of the different ‘sections’ are present (give someone who sees 
							one section a chance to be exposed to other parts), composition of the main
							wall felt scattered and could be more intentional (a strategy is to impose 
							one limitation per drawing sketch to see how compositions respond to each 
							limitation), prefer compositional tightness to the scattering and absence of 
							composition in main frame does disservice to concep (improve through a 
							greater intent behind scattering)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Dissecting ‘the publication’:
					<ul>
						<li>
							the authority of ‘the written word’ versus ‘the voice’ in different cultures
						</li>
						<li>
							percieved orientation (for example books not often rotated as read)
						</li>
						<li>
							the hegemony of the margin
						</li>
						<li>
							margins always thought of as space (not, for example, block elements like thick lines)
						</li>
						<li>
							Western stoic attitude, pleasure is suspicious, space for experimentation thought 
							as for art and poetry or only for ‘special occasions’, publications with mundain
							uses are never elevated
						</li>
						<li>
							the one logic that you have to subscribe to, otherwise not considered practical
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Reflection on current practice:
					<ul>
						<li>
							single volume spanning multiple mediums, publication as unbound
							space, concept of publication is fluid and constantly changing
						</li>
						<li>
							take a step back (big ideas have already been though of) zoom in and think about 
							scope of each work, think through strengths and weaknesses
						</li>
						<li>
							make pairings, think of the way mediums have more chemistry with other mediums
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Typography and culture:
					<ul>
						<li>
							interogate biases
						</li>
						<li>
							ask what is important culturally and why
						</li>
						<li>
							Western typography is characterised based on visuals (what are other ways to categorise, for example phonetically)
						</li>
						<li>
							how to deal with English ‘loan’ words
						</li>
						<li>
							typeface informs language which informs identity which informs culture etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							instances where latin characters have been imposed on cultures that have 
							no connections
						</li>
						<li>
							changes to typography to make it more amenable to printing
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Typographic research pointers:
					<ul>
						<li>
							start documenting facts that are available to you
						</li>
						<li>
							history building, try to put pieces together
						</li>
						<li>
							put together a timeline (for example when was the first print document, when was the first digital document)
						</li>
						<li>
							example of a First Nations typographic project: https://www.typotheque.com/blog/north_american_syllabics_fonts

				On 9 February was a grant workshop session with Auspicious Arts at the Centre for 
				Projection Art space.
			</p>

			<button class="button" onclick="showSection('s-21')">
				<h2 id="p1">Some notes from the workshop</h2></label>
			</button>
			<div id="s-21" class="section">
				<p>
					Auspicious Arts:
					<ul>
						<li>
							main concern is approving the budget
						</li>
						<li>
							sometimes artists work with Auspicious Arts because employing other people
						</li>
						<li>
							get in contact at least 10 days before the deadline
						</li>
						<li>
							they manage budget, superannuation
						</li>
						<li>
							makes doing tax a lot easier
						</li>
						<li>
							Auspicious Arts take legal responsibility for projects and deal with contracts
						</li>
						<li>
							no project too small, open door policy on art form, scale etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							predominately metropolitan artists, some regional and interstate
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					First step – Research:
					<ul>
						<li>
							read the guidelines early on, highlight important parts
						</li>
						<li>
							find out if you are eligible
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Second step – Strategy and Planning:
					<ul>
						<li>
							build in contingency time, aim to submit a couple of days before
						</li>
						<li>
							people not often get top amount of funding
						</li>
						<li>
							hard to get first one on the board, get a smaller grant and leverage it, money attracts money, break funding down into stages increases chances of success
						</li>
						<li>
							get a sense of where you fit
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Third step – Budget:
					<ul>
						<li>
							recommend doing first
						</li>
						<li>
							work out whether project is viable, if not enough money to cover everything look where else can you apply for funding or how can you scale the project down
						</li>
						<li>
							think of as shopping list
						</li>
						<li>
							ball park is fine
						</li>
						<li>
							a detailed budget shows viability
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Fourth step – Support Materials:
					<ul>
						<li>
							investing time, energy and skill into amazing support materials, more important than rest of application as often what is looked at first
						</li>
						<li>
							get creative, an example of support material is to get someone to interview you about your work
						</li>
						<li>
							videos should be no more than two minutes, snappy and dynamic, only best bits, engage assessors
						</li>
						<li>
							overall practice or specific to project, depends on grant, could include both
						</li>
						<li>
							how can you make it easy for (support letters, give notice, give false deadline, give them dot points)
						</li>
						<li>
							make support letters reusable (don’t get them dated or mention specific grant but check to see if they’re with each application)
						</li>
						<li>
							can also get support letter from a partner in project when providing something in kind
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Fifth step – Application:
					<ul>
						<li>
							assessment criteria
						</li>
						<li>
							use grant speak (simple, effective, clarity, avoid art speak)
						</li>
						<li>
							confidence (for example I am doing this, we will do this, you give me this and this is what will happen, this is going to strongly impact the community by doing this…)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Sixth step – Outcome:
					<ul>
						<li>
							generally have to wait three months
						</li>
						<li>
							outcome success rates are usually 10–25%
						</li>
						<li>
							always a good idea to ring up and get feedback
						</li>
						<li>
							outcome can depend on panel, projects you’re up against etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							if unsuccessful take the opportunity to refine the idea
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Timeline:
					<ul>
						<li>
							think of project as past, present, future
						</li>
						<li>
							funding application is present
						</li>
						<li>
							future is what happens to project after funded period, assessors want to know there will be life beyond funded period, looking for projects with a long life
						</li>
						<li>
							one page, three stages (past, present, future), dot point form, not super detailed
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					In-kind Support:
					<ul>
						<li>
							usually includes your time, someone else’s time, equipment, venue hire
						</li>
						<li>
							some grants especially want artists to be paid (for example Creative Victoria no time in-kind, AusCo about 25% in-kind)
						</li>
						<li>
							mentor time (paid through other sources) in-kind
						</li>
						<li>
							accomodation, fuel, transport can be listed as in-kind
						</li>
						<li>
							can get support letter for in-kind equipment
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Benefits:
					<ul>
						<li>
							especially if applying for council funding
						</li>
						<li>
							what are the ripple benefits (for example benefits to other artists, people who get to see the work, people who relate to themes)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Contact:
					<ul>
						<li>
							ring, meetings, ask to breakdown questions
						</li>
						<li>
							have clear questions and notes
						</li>
						<li>
							tell them about project, could ask what grant would be best
						</li>
						<li>
							ask if they will give you the full amount or a percentage (reflect answer in budget to make project viable)
						</li>
						<li>
							ask about support letters
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Viability:
					<ul>
						<li>
							budget making sense, does it tell the same story as you application
						</li>
						<li>
							artistic vision and impact most important, but budget may lift you above other applications
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					General Advice:
					<ul>
						<li>
							sit on funding panels, get paid, artists at any level
						</li>
						<li>
							give to people in your industry and someone outside of it to read
						</li>
						<li>
							have statistics, government reports, other evidence etc. as evidence of claims
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Crafting Aotearoa: a Cultural History of making in New Zealand and the Wider Moana Oceania</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					‘And why Moana Oceania, rather than the Pacific, the more common name for
					this part of the world? That name “Pacific” was given to this region by
					a Portuguese navigator and explorer in 1521. Ferdinand Magellan’s “Mar
					Pacifico” —the peaceful sea— emphasises a narrow perception of the
					peoples and places of Moana Oceania as peaceful, tranquil and passive,
					which is not how Indigenous peoples from this region see themselves.
					Pacific has become Pasifika, Pasefika or Pasifiki, but these
					transliterations are derived from the same root. Moana means ocean in
					the Māori language and in other island nations such as the Cook Islands,
					Hawai’i, Sāmoa and Tonga. While it can never be truly inclusive because
					of the diversity of languages and cultures of Moana Oceania peoples, it
					has meaning and relevance to this place.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oceania is another foreign name that was first used in the early
					nineteenth century. Today it is a popular alternative for Pacific
					because it suggests a sea of islands connected to each other, rather
					than isolated islands in a far sea.<sup>1</sup> It is a name that is more
					meaningful to island nations that do not have the word moana in their
					languages.<sup>2</sup> Together, Moana Oceania empowers and privileges Indigenous
					perspectives. It embodies a worldview that is strongly connected to
					Aotearoa but has its roots in the wider region.’

					<h3>Decolonizing Research: Indigenous Storywork as Methodology</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					‘Archibald coined the term, “Indigenous stonework” so that storytellers, story listeners/learners, researchers, and educators can pay better attention to and engage with Indigenous stories for meaningful education and research. The outcomes of Archibald’s story research included the development of an Indigenous theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical framework comprising seven principles: respect, responsibility, reverence, reciprocity, holism, interrelatedness, and synergy.’

					<h3>Marinade: Aotearoa Journal of Moana Art 01</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					‘A new arts journal co-edited by Ioana Gordon-Smith and Lana Lopesi. Marinade marks the overdue need for more writing on Pacific art, becoming the first Aotearoa journal focused explicitly on Moana arts from Aotearoa. It aims to capture the wealth of not only Pacific art, but the discussions that have followed and driven Pacific arts in Aotearoa over the past few decades. With texts written by leading scholars, artists and extraordinary new talent, Marinade offers a critical resource for all enthusiasts of Moana art.’

					‘Because “I wuz hia”: A Message for Lulu, the Emerging Arkheion’ by Teresia Teaiwa.
				</p>
				<p>
					‘Can we trust Google to do all our remembering for us? Can we trust Archives New Zealand to do it? National Library of New Zealand? Auckland Museum? Te Papa? Lulu thinks not.
				</p>
				<p>
					If Jacques Derrida were still alive, he might declar that Lulu is experiencing “archive fever”. Antoinette Burton summarises the condition this way: "contemporary archive fever is bound up with convictions about the power of science to get at the truth. Indeed, the most popular archive stories of the new millennium are shaped by a belief in the capacity of material evidence to create and sustain tests of verificability.”
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s pretty rich for cultures that have built rapacious empires on their ability to exclude or marginalise whole categories of people from official memory to now suggest that the desire for verificability is problematic.’

					<h3>The Form of the Book Book</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Foreword by Sara De Bondt & Fraser Muggeridge.
				</p>
				<p>
					‘Yet what the texts collected here have in common is an interest in the book as a material space for critical self-reflection and exchange.’
				</p>
				<p>
					‘The Matta-Clark Complex: Materials, Interpretation and the Designer’ by James Goggin.
				</p>
				<p>
					‘Books are three-dimensional objects of which the designer must consider the aesthetic, functional and structural aspects.
					Effective use of materials can succinctly communicate a book’s content, imbue it with a certain character and simply compel a reader to pick it up.
				</p>
				<p>
					A key role of the designer is not only to take interest in a book’s content, but also to research and understand it.
					Critical analysis of the content and application of this knowledge usually result in a well-designed book, both aesthetically and conceptually.
				</p>
				<p>
					With particular artists, one risks reducing to parody the very content of the book, or even blurring the lines between ‘the work’ and ‘the document’. The book should subjectively communicate the work in a sympathetic way but not attempt to be the work, or risk being mistaken as such.
				</p>
				<p>
						This last observation highlights a key dilemma: where does the designer draw the line between engagement with content and pure decoration?
						Although consideration of a project’s content and context remains crucial, the question reminds us to consider the book itself as a functional object.
						The quality of the book’s constituent parts can be prioritised, a particularly basic requirement that is surprisingly often overlooked by contemporary designers.
				</p>
				<p>
					An awareness of over-interpretation needn’t imply a kind of unattainable (and undesirable) objectivity, but rather a thoughtful subjective approach, which does not involve second-guessing the artist.
					When the content and materials are interpreted and combined in a balanced way, the result can be greater than the sum of its parts.'
				</p>
				<p>
					‘Ways of Seeing Books’ by Richard Hollis.
				</p>
				<p>
					‘Rethink the book functions in their physical, optical and psychological aspects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite considerable effort during the past thirty years to evolve a style of book design in the spirit of contemporary aesthetics and technology, the prevailing criterion of judgement is still the hand-printed-and-bound books of pre-Industrial Revolution eras... books which reflect the culture of their periods.
				</p>
				<p>
					It seems incongruous that today (...) we should yet strive to design books with conventions perfected centuries ago. (...) we must turn our eyes ahead, not backward, in designing the books of today.
				</p>
				<p>
					In short, the form of the book has not changed significantly over the centuries ...
					Once a craft, book making has become an industrial process ...
					And the standardisation and success of this form of printed text, its ability to convey a narrative and give it a structure and sequence, has been frustrating to designers. They are left with little scope for invention.
				</p>
				<p>
					But the various historical avant-gardes – Futurists, Dadaists, Russian Contructivits, the Bauhaus masters – did not challenge the physical form of the book.
					They wanted to extend the ways in which the page could “speak” to the reader. They were asking for graphics to be updated, with slogans such as Moholy-Nagy’s: “Typography is the communication of ideas through printed design.”
				</p>
				<p>
					The majority of our books today have come no further in their typographical, visual, synoptical form...
				</p>
				<p>
					Moholy-Nagy did his best to break with traditional layout of film scripts in his “Painting Photography Film (Albert Langen Verlag, 1925)”, a book full of wild contrasts between words and images.
					The later “Vision in Motion” uses a more sober style, but deploys the main text, images and extended captions in the same way as illustrated magazines, allowing the reader to “operate” in two ways.
					First, to skim through, looking at the pictures and captions and, second, after this familisation with the book’s general ideas, to settle into the text.’
