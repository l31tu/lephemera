					Centre for Projection Art's Artist-In-Residence program pairs an artist who
					is emerging and experimenting with projection through their contemporary art
					practice, with an artist mentor for four months.  This provides
					opportunities for artists to develop their creative skills in the projection
					field, develop new artwork for public presentation, collaborate and expand
					their professional networks.

				<p>
					I wish to become projection literate in order to expand my film and digital
					work beyond the boundaries of screens and into activations in
					three-dimensional space. Extending upon my experience and interest in
					technologies, I am looking to to construct immersive and interactive
					experiences that promote juxtaposition and exchange between virtual worlds
					and physical environments. In particular I will focus on
					developing a forthcoming exhibition that is an unconventional hybrid of
					documentary, narrative and publication. I also hope to find ways to
					integrate projected imagery into the traditionally non-digital facets of my
					practice including wearables and objects.

				<h3>Crafting Aotearoa: a Cultural History of making in New Zealand and the Wider Moana Oceania</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				'And why Moana Oceania, rather than the Pacific, the more common name for
				this part of the world? That name "Pacific" was given to this region by
				a Portuguese navigator and explorer in 1521. Ferdinand Magellan's "Mar
				Pacifico" —the peaceful sea— emphasises a narrow perception of the
				peoples and places of Moana Oceania as peaceful, tranquil and passive,
				which is not how Indigenous peoples from this region see themselves.
				Pacific has become Pasifika, Pasefika or Pasifiki, but these
				transliterations are derived from the same root. Moana means ocean in
				the Māori language and in other island nations such as the Cook Islands,
				Hawai'i, Sāmoa and Tonga. While it can never be truly inclusive because
				of the diversity of languages and cultures of Moana Oceania peoples, it
				has meaning and relevance to this place.
			</p>
			<p>
				Oceania is another foreign name that was first used in the early
				nineteenth century. Today it is a popular alternative for Pacific
				because it suggests a sea of islands connected to each other, rather
				than isolated islands in a far sea.<sup>1</sup> It is a name that is more
				meaningful to island nations that do not have the word moana in their
				languages.<sup>2</sup> Together, Moana Oceania empowers and privileges Indigenous
				perspectives. It embodies a worldview that is strongly connected to
				Aotearoa but has its roots in the wider region.'
			</p>

				1. Se 'Epili Hau'ofa, 'We Are the Oceania: Selected works', University of
				Hawai'i Press, Honolulu, 2008, for an indepth understanding of the term
				Oceania. See also a great discussion paper on imposed terms of
				convenience called
				<a href="http://unprojects.org.au/magazine/issues/issue-9-2/terms-of-convenience/">'Terms of Convenience' </a>
				written by Ioana Gordon-Smith.

				artists, acedemics and professionals around the term "moana".'

				<h3>Decolonizing Research: Indigenous Storywork as Methodology</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				'Archibald coined the term, “Indigenous stonework” so that storytellers, story listeners/learners, researchers, and educators can pay better attention to and engage with Indigenous stories for meaningful education and research. The outcomes of Archibald’s story research included the development of an Indigenous theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical framework comprising seven principles: respect, responsibility, reverence, reciprocity, holism, interrelatedness, and synergy.'

				<h3>Marinade: Aotearoa Journal of Moana Art 01</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				'A new arts journal co-edited by Ioana Gordon-Smith and Lana Lopesi. Marinade marks the overdue need for more writing on Pacific art, becoming the first Aotearoa journal focused explicitly on Moana arts from Aotearoa. It aims to capture the wealth of not only Pacific art, but the discussions that have followed and driven Pacific arts in Aotearoa over the past few decades. With texts written by leading scholars, artists and extraordinary new talent, Marinade offers a critical resource for all enthusiasts of Moana art.'

				'Because "I wuz hia": A Message for Lulu, the Emerging Arkheion' by Teresia Teaiwa.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Can we trust Google to do all our remembering for us? Can we trust Archives New Zealand to do it? National Library of New Zealand? Auckland Museum? Te Papa? Lulu thinks not.
			</p>
			<p>
				If Jacques Derrida were still alive, he might declar that Lulu is experiencing "archive fever". Antoinette Burton summarises the condition this way: "contemporary archive fever is bound up with convictions about the power of science to get at the truth. Indeed, the most popular archive stories of the new millennium are shaped by a belief in the capacity of material evidence to create and sustain tests of verificability."
			</p>
			<p>
				It's pretty rich for cultures that have built rapacious empires on their ability to exclude or marginalise whole categories of people from official memory to now suggest that the desire for verificability is problematic.'
