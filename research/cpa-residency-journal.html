					Centre for Projection Art's Artist-In-Residence program pairs an artist who
					is emerging and experimenting with projection through their contemporary art
					practice, with an artist mentor for four months.  This provides
					opportunities for artists to develop their creative skills in the projection
					field, develop new artwork for public presentation, collaborate and expand
					their professional networks.

				<p>
					I wish to become projection literate in order to expand my film and digital
					work beyond the boundaries of screens and into activations in
					three-dimensional space. Extending upon my experience and interest in
					technologies, I am looking to construct immersive and interactive
					experiences that promote juxtaposition and exchange between virtual worlds
					and physical environments. In particular I will focus on
					developing a forthcoming exhibition that is an unconventional hybrid of
					documentary, narrative and publication. I also hope to find ways to
					integrate projected imagery into the traditionally non-digital facets of my
					practice including wearables and objects.

					<h3>Crafting Aotearoa: a Cultural History of making in New Zealand and the Wider Moana Oceania</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					'And why Moana Oceania, rather than the Pacific, the more common name for
					this part of the world? That name "Pacific" was given to this region by
					a Portuguese navigator and explorer in 1521. Ferdinand Magellan's "Mar
					Pacifico" —the peaceful sea— emphasises a narrow perception of the
					peoples and places of Moana Oceania as peaceful, tranquil and passive,
					which is not how Indigenous peoples from this region see themselves.
					Pacific has become Pasifika, Pasefika or Pasifiki, but these
					transliterations are derived from the same root. Moana means ocean in
					the Māori language and in other island nations such as the Cook Islands,
					Hawai'i, Sāmoa and Tonga. While it can never be truly inclusive because
					of the diversity of languages and cultures of Moana Oceania peoples, it
					has meaning and relevance to this place.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oceania is another foreign name that was first used in the early
					nineteenth century. Today it is a popular alternative for Pacific
					because it suggests a sea of islands connected to each other, rather
					than isolated islands in a far sea.<sup>1</sup> It is a name that is more
					meaningful to island nations that do not have the word moana in their
					languages.<sup>2</sup> Together, Moana Oceania empowers and privileges Indigenous
					perspectives. It embodies a worldview that is strongly connected to
					Aotearoa but has its roots in the wider region.'
				</p>

					Hawai'i Press, Honolulu, 2008, for an indepth understanding of the term

					<h3>Decolonizing Research: Indigenous Storywork as Methodology</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					'Archibald coined the term, “Indigenous stonework” so that storytellers, story listeners/learners, researchers, and educators can pay better attention to and engage with Indigenous stories for meaningful education and research. The outcomes of Archibald’s story research included the development of an Indigenous theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical framework comprising seven principles: respect, responsibility, reverence, reciprocity, holism, interrelatedness, and synergy.'

					<h3>Marinade: Aotearoa Journal of Moana Art 01</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					'A new arts journal co-edited by Ioana Gordon-Smith and Lana Lopesi. Marinade marks the overdue need for more writing on Pacific art, becoming the first Aotearoa journal focused explicitly on Moana arts from Aotearoa. It aims to capture the wealth of not only Pacific art, but the discussions that have followed and driven Pacific arts in Aotearoa over the past few decades. With texts written by leading scholars, artists and extraordinary new talent, Marinade offers a critical resource for all enthusiasts of Moana art.'

					'Because "I wuz hia": A Message for Lulu, the Emerging Arkheion' by Teresia Teaiwa.
				</p>
				<p>
					'Can we trust Google to do all our remembering for us? Can we trust Archives New Zealand to do it? National Library of New Zealand? Auckland Museum? Te Papa? Lulu thinks not.
				</p>
				<p>
					If Jacques Derrida were still alive, he might declar that Lulu is experiencing "archive fever". Antoinette Burton summarises the condition this way: "contemporary archive fever is bound up with convictions about the power of science to get at the truth. Indeed, the most popular archive stories of the new millennium are shaped by a belief in the capacity of material evidence to create and sustain tests of verificability."
				</p>
				<p>
					It's pretty rich for cultures that have built rapacious empires on their ability to exclude or marginalise whole categories of people from official memory to now suggest that the desire for verificability is problematic.'

					<h3>The Form of the Book Book</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Foreword by Sara De Bondt & Fraser Muggeridge.
				</p>
				<p>
					'Yet what the texts collected here have in common is an interest in the book as a material space for critical self-reflection and exchange.'
				</p>
				<p>
					'The Matta-Clark Complex: Materials, Interpretation and the Designer' by James Goggin.
				</p>
				<p>
					'Books are three-dimensional objects of which the designer must consider the aesthetic, functional and structural aspects.
					Effective use of materials can succinctly communicate a book's content, imbue it with a certain character and simply compel a reader to pick it up.
				</p>
				<p>
					A key role of the designer is not only to take interest in a book's content, but also to research and understand it.
					Critical analysis of the content and application of this knowledge usually result in a well-designed book, both aesthetically and conceptually.
				</p>
				<p>
					With particular artists, one risks reducing to parody the very content of the book, or even blurring the lines between 'the work' and 'the document'. The book should subjectively communicate the work in a sympathetic way but not attempt to be the work, or risk being mistaken as such.
				</p>
				<p>
						This last observation highlights a key dilemma: where does the designer draw the line between engagement with content and pure decoration?
						Although consideration of a project's content and context remains crucial, the question reminds us to consider the book itself as a functional object.
						The quality of the book's constituent parts can be prioritised, a particularly basic requirement that is surprisingly often overlooked by contemporary designers.
				</p>
				<p>
					An awareness of over-interpretation needn't imply a kind of unattainable (and undesirable) objectivity, but rather a thoughtful subjective approach, which does not involve second-guessing the artist.
					When the content and materials are interpreted and combined in a balanced way, the result can be greater than the sum of its parts.'
				</p>
				<p>
					'Ways of Seeing Books' by Richard Hollis.
				</p>
				<p>
					'Rethink the book functions in their physical, optical and psychological aspects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite considerable effort during the past thirty years to evolve a style of book design in the spirit of contemporary aesthetics and technology, the prevailing criterion of judgement is still the hand-printed-and-bound books of pre-Industrial Revolution eras... books which reflect the culture of their periods.
				</p>
				<p>
					It seems incongruous that today (...) we should yet strive to design books with conventions perfected centuries ago. (...) we must turn our eyes ahead, not backward, in designing the books of today.
				</p>
				<p>
					In short, the form of the book has not changed significantly over the centuries ...
					Once a craft, book making has become an industrial process ...
					And the standardisation and success of this form of printed text, its ability to convey a narrative and give it a structure and sequence, has been frustrating to designers. They are left with little scope for invention.
				</p>
				<p>
					But the various historical avant-gardes – Futurists, Dadaists, Russian Contructivits, the Bauhaus masters – did not challenge the physical form of the book.
					They wanted to extend the ways in which the page could "speak" to the reader. They were asking for graphics to be updated, with slogans such as Moholy-Nagy's: "Typography is the communication of ideas through printed design."
				</p>
				<p>
					The majority of our books today have come no further in their typographical, visual, synoptical form...
				</p>
				<p>
					Moholy-Nagy did his best to break with traditional layout of film scripts in his "Painting Photography Film (Albert Langen Verlag, 1925)", a book full of wild contrasts between words and images.
					The later "Vision in Motion" uses a more sober style, but deploys the main text, images and extended captions in the same way as illustrated magazines, allowing the reader to "operate" in two ways.
					First, to skim through, looking at the pictures and captions and, second, after this familisation with the book's general ideas, to settle into the text.'
