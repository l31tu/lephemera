			'Afa'afakasi is an ongoing project attempting to reconnect to Gagana Sāmoa
			(Samoan language) and Fa'a Sāmoa (the Samoan way / Samoan culture).
			Lomiga Tasi (Issue One) has been created in celebration of Vaiaso o le
			Gagana Sāmoa (Samoan Language Week) which runs from Sunday 29 May to
			Saturday 4 June, 2022.
		</p>
		<p>
			This issue is called Folasaga Lona Lua (Second Introduction) and will
			focus on basic words and phrases. The aim is also to playfully explore
			physical and digital distance, as well as collective memory.

		<h1>Gagana Sāmoa (Samoan language)</h1>

		<p>
			Gagana Sāmoa, pronounced like 'ngah-ngah-nah sah-moh-ah', is one of the
			five Samoic languages, the others are Tuvaluan, Tokelauan, Pukapukan and Niuafo'ou.
			It is also similar to other languages of the pacific such as te reo Māori,
			lea faka-Tonga, vagahau Niue, 'ōlelo Hawai'i, and te reo Kuki Airani (Cook Islands Māori).
		</p>
		<p>
			There are three levels of Gagana Sāmoa.
			Everyday gagana is used with friends, family and acquaintances.
			Formal gagana is used when talking to strangers and people of status.
			Formal gagana fa'amatai is the language used by matai.

	<!-- PAGE 13: Faaleoga / Pronunciation -->
	<section>

		<h1>Faaleoga (pronunciation)</h1>

		<p>
			In Gagana Sāmoa words are pronounced as they are written.
			Konesona (consonants) are always followed by a vaueli (vowel).
			There are fifteen original letters in the Samoan alphabet including the
			('), koma liliu or ʻokina (glottal stop), which is like the middle of 'uh-oh'.
			Three letters are borrowed from the English alphabet (H, K and R).
		</p>
		<p>
			All the konesona have the same sounds as in the English alphabet with the
			exception of ‘G’, which is pronounced as ‘NG', and 'P' which is pronounced closer to 'B'.
			When speaking casually 'T' is often replaced with a 'K' sound, 'N' becomes 'NG' and 'R' becomes 'L'.
			Generally when prounouncing words the second last syllable is emphasised.

	<!-- PAGE 16: Vaueli -->
	<section>
		<h1>Vaueli (vowels)</h1>

		<p>
			In gagana Sāmoa both short vaueli sounds and long vaueli sounds are used,
			for example 'A' and 'Ā'.
			Every vaueli in a word is sounded out.
			The only exceptions are when 'i' and 'u' are followed by unnaccented vaueli.
			The 'i' changes to a 'y' sound and 'u' changes to a 'w' sound.
			Examples include vaiaso (week) which is pronounced 'vai-yah-soh',
			and uila (bike) which is pronounced 'wee-lah'.
		</p>
		<p>
			When two vaueli are side by side they are each given their own pronunciation,
			but often 'run together'.
			An example is vae (leg) and vai (water).
			To someone who does not speak gagana Sāmoa they could sound very similar
			as 'ae' and 'ai' both create sounds similar to 'eye' in English.

		<p>
			Siva (dance) is performed at both formal and informal events and is an

			There are a number of traditional dances including the fa'ataupati
			(slap dance) and sāsā (a type of group dance).
		</p>
		<p>
			In the fa'ataupati, percussion is intensified by slapping of chests,
			sides, thighs and stamping of the feet.
			Contemporary versions can incorporate other dance genres like hip hop.
			Sāsā involves a sequence of choreographed movements performed by a group
			moving to the steady beat of a pātē (tin drum).

		<p>
			Mea'ai (food) is a critical aspect of fa'asāmoa. When entertaining guests,
			it is important to make sure that there is enough food for everyone and
			some left over for guests to take home.
			Traditionally just the men prepared food, however now it is usually a
			shared responsibility amongst the family.
			In many Samoan families, there are two main meals a day with the main one
			in the evening when all members of the family are at home.
		</p>
		<p>
			The traditional way to prepare food is in an umu (earth oven). It is still
			the preferred method for making large amounts for special occasions, but is now used less often.
			Food that can be cooked in an umu include taro, ufi (yam) and 'ulu (breadfruit).

		<h1>'Āiga (family)</h1>

		<p>
			An elemental part of fa'asāmoa is 'āiga (family), pronounced 'eye-ing-ah'.
			In samoan culture there is no great distinction between immediate and
			extended family. The concept of 'āiga includes aunties, uncles,
			grandparents, great grandparents, cousins and other distant relatives.
			In Sāmoa generally all elders are seen as the parents and children as
			sisters and brothers regardless of relation or generation.
			This is illustrated by the fact that the word tausoga (cousin) is a
			relatively recent word to gagana Sāmoa.
			The slang word kasegi, pronounced 'kah-seh-ngee', is more commonly used for cousin.

		<h2>Discussion over lo-fi digital sketches representing Sāmoa:</h2>

		<p>
			Bread, but it looks like a farmhouse loaf. No, more of like a curved shape big loaf.<br>
			How would you describe 'āiga?<br>
			Inclusive.<br>
			But how do we draw that?<br>
			A circle?<br>
			Which one? A plain circle?<br>
			That layered circle.<br>
			Definitely not that type of dance.<br>
			Faleo'o.<br>
			I mean usually our walls are open but that's very similar.<br>
			It doesn't matter. It just shows that it's a home.<br>
			A village is a big community and everyone looks after each other. It's not
			just your immediate family that looks after you.<br>
			Maybe like hands and I'll just draw a lot of them.<br>
			Using what they have and being more independent instead of relying on
			western food. Eat healthier.

		<h1>La'u sootaga (my connection)</h1>

		<p>
			A play on the term ‘afakasi (half Samoan), ‘Afa‘afakasi essentially means
			half of a half Samoan. This new term was created to raise questions around
			racial classifications and connection to, or disconnection from heritage.
			My grandpa was born and raised in Samoa but I am mostly of European
			ethnicity and removed from Samoan culture. The knowledge that I have has
			been gained through interactions with family, as a tourist in Samoa and
			through my own research.
